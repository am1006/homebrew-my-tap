# am1006's brew tap

> It's May 17th 2023. Nerd font 3.0 broke my terminal look. So I need to fix it by creating my own tap.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install am1006/homebrew-my-tap/<formula>`

Or `brew tap am1006/homebrew-my-tap` and then `brew install <formula>` or `brew install --cask <cask>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
